# Raspberry Pi Cluster Ansible Automation

## What does this stuff do?

This repository contains opinionated playbooks that can be used to prepare a cluster of raspberry pis to run K3s

The `prep-*.yml` playbooks will handle the initial configuration of the pi. These playbooks update the base software, assign an IP address, enable ssh, enable 64bit OS, and run an initial update & upgrade of the OS.

The `intialize.yml` playbook will change the default credentials, lock the default pi account, create a new sudo enabled user, enable ssh authentication using a key-pair, install a firewall, and more.

The `k3s-*.yml` playbooks will configure master and server nodes and get the cluster online.

**Warning: The intialize.yml playbook disables Wi-Fi & Bluetooth - comment these sections out if you need them**

## Directions

**Edit `hosts:` in each playbook before running**
**Warning: The `intialize.yml` playbook disables Wi-Fi & Bluetooth**

1. Flash RaspianOS Lite onto your SD card(s) using the Raspian Imager
2. Perform Initial Boot
   1. Plug the SD card into the Pi
   2. Plug in power
   3. Wait 2 minutes
   4. Disconnect power
   5. Remove SD card
3. Run `ansible-playbook prep-local.yml`
4. Plug the SD card back into the Pi & connect power
5. Test connection to the pi `ping -c 5 <IP ADDRESS>`
6. If the ping is successful `ssh` into the pi and run `sudo rpi-update`
7. Rename `inventory_template.yml` to `inventory.yml`
8. Fill out the `inventory.yml` file with information about your devices
   1. The attached template is geared toward a cluster (mine has 1 master and 4 nodes)
9. Run `ansible-playbook ping.yml` to test that Ansible can contact the pi(s)
10. Run `ansible-playbook prep-remote.yml`
11. Run `ansible-playbook initialize.yml`
12. Edit the `inventory.yml` and remove the `pi_ssh_passwordword` entry and change the `ansible_ssh_host` to your new username
13. Run `ansible-playbook k3s-prep.yml`
14. Run `k3s-master.yml -K`
    1. The `BECOME` password prompt is asking for you local machine sudo password so that it can write the master token to a file
15. Run `k3s-nodes.yml`

**Edit `hosts:` in each playbook before running**
**Warning: The `intialize.yml` playbook disables Wi-Fi & Bluetooth**

## Requirements

`ansible` installed on your control node

`sshpass` for initial `ssh` connection until the key-pair is configured:

    Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install sshpass

    MacOS
    brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass

`ansible-galaxy collection install community.general`

`ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix`

## Useful Commands

SSH to an IP

```
ssh user@0.0.0.0
```

Start a playbook
`ansible-playbook PLAYBOOK_NAME`

Review the inventory JSON
`ansible-inventory --list`
Use `-i /path/to/inventoryfile` if different from inventory file specified in `ansible.cfg`

Generate SSH keys (save them to the `/keys` dir)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Ansible - pass extra variables when running commands

```
--extra-vars newpassword=12345678 example=lilyhammer
```

### Gotchas

If you're like me and had to re-image a pi and start from scratch (and you used the same ip as the first go-round) you may come across this error when attempting to connect to the re-imaged pi(s)

```

fatal: [master]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\r\n@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @\r\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\r\nIT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!\r\nSomeone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!\r\nIt is also possible that a host key has just been changed.\r\nThe fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is\nSHA256:vm3d/KZcb0Ncgo1H+MIumOwp1KZTWBZZqI7tjjpkybk.\r\nPlease contact your system administrator.\r\nAdd correct host key in /Users/user/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.\r\nOffending ECDSA key in /Users/user/.ssh/known_hosts:5\r\nPassword authentication is disabled to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.\r\nKeyboard-interactive authentication is disabled to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.\r\npi@192.168.1.70: Permission denied (publickey,password).", "unreachable": true}

```

Solution - delete the old entry (entire line) with the ip address of the re-imaged node in `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. Using `vim` you can highlight over the line in question while in CMD mode and type `dd`

### To - Do's

Make `prep-remote.yml` use a special host group for new pis while also adding them to cluster & node groups
